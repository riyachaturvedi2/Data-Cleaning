Hi! 
This is a repository for my previous python coding projects- academic, professional or personal 

A brief overview of the included files in this repository: 
1. worldbank_data: In this file I use the open source data downloaded from World Bank's site to create a panel dataset for my research project on the impact of gender inequality
   on maternal mortality rates worldwide. I needed the MMR variable as the main outcome variable and GNI, GINI and government expenditure on healthcare data are control variables.
  In this file I convert the wide world bank data to long and merge files in a way so as to ensure that the missing values in the control variable datasets do not delete the recorded
  values in the main MMR dataset. 
2. maternal_deaths: In this file I use data I downloaded from the government of mexico's website which lists maternal deaths in mexico over the years by characteristic. The characteristics
   of interest to me were particularly education level and age. I create time-series depictions of maternal deaths in Mexico by age group and education levels. I also clean the data and
   create new variables in the dataset using functions and loops.
