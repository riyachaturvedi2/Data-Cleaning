QUESTION 1

In this question, you'll be replicating the graph from Lecture 14, slide 5
which shows the population of Europe from 0 AD to the present day in both
the linear and the log scale. You can find the data in population.csv, and the
variable names are self-explanatory.

Open this data and replicate the graph.

QUESTION 2

A country's "capital stock" is the value of its' physical capital, which includes the 
stock of equipment, buildings, and other durable goods used in the production 
of goods and services. Macroeconomists seem to conisder it important to have 
public policies that encourage the growth of capital stock. Why is that?

In this exercise we will look at the relationship between capital stock and 
GDP. You can find data from the IMF in "capitalstock.csv" and documentation in
"capitalstock documentation.txt".

In this exercise we will only be using the variables that are demarcated in
thousands of 2017 international dollars to adjust for variation in the value 
of nominal national currency. Hint: These are the the variables that 
end in _rppp.

1. Open the dataset capitalstock.csv and limit the dataframe to only 
observations from 2018

2. Construct a variable called "capital_stock" that is the sum of the general
government capital stock and private capital stock. Drop 
observations where the value of capital stock is 0 or missing. (We will be 
ignoring public-private partnership capital stock for the purpose of t
his exercise.)

3. Create a scatterplot showing the relationship between log GDP and log
capital stock. Put capital stock on the y-axis. Add the line of best 
fit. Add labels where appropriate and make any cosmetic adjustments you want.

4. Estimate a model of the relationship between the log of GDP 
and the log of capital stock using OLS. GDP is the dependent 
variable. Print a table showing the details of your model and, using comments, 
interpret the coefficient on capital stock.

## 1. Loading & sub-setting data 
path2 = r"C:/Users/Riya/Desktop/Harris Year 1/Spring Quarter/Data & Programming I Python/capitalstock.csv"
capital_stock = pd.read_csv(path2)
capital_stock2018 = capital_stock[capital_stock['year'] == 2018]

## 2. Cleaning data 
capital_stock2018['capital_stock'] = capital_stock2018['kgov_rppp'] + capital_stock2018['kpriv_rppp']
capital_stock2018 = capital_stock2018.replace(np.nan , 0)
capital_stock2018 = capital_stock2018.loc[capital_stock2018.capital_stock != 0]

## 3. Creating the scatter plot 
gdp_rppp = np.log(capital_stock2018["GDP_rppp"])
capital_stock_y = np.log(capital_stock2018["capital_stock"])

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
m , b = np.polyfit(gdp_rppp , capital_stock_y , 1)
gen_line = np.poly1d((m , b))
ax.scatter(gdp_rppp , capital_stock_y, color = "blue")
ax.plot(gdp_rppp, gen_line(gdp_rppp), color = "black")
ax.set_title("Relationship between log GDP and log Capital Stock (in thousands of 2017 intl $)")
ax.set_xlabel("log(GDP)")
ax.set_ylabel("log(capital stock)")

## 4. Creating regression model 
from statsmodels.regression.linear_model import OLS 

capital_stock2018["intercept"] = np.ones(len(capital_stock2018))

reg_model = OLS(endog = ["gdp_rppp"],
                exog = [ "intercept", "capital_stock_y"]) 
result = reg_model 
print(result.summary())

## The beta value 0.9758 indicates that a 1% increase in capital stock will result in a 0.9758% increase in GDP for a country, if all else remains constant.
