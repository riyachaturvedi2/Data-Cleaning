## Data and Programming Python Coursework 4: Data Scraping & Loops 

"""
HOMEWORK 4

You and your roommate have decieded to delve into the history of US cinema,
choosing a random blockbuster every Friday to watch. The problem, of course, is
that (a) you don't have a list of US blockbusters and (b) your roommate is 
indecisive and choosing a "random" movie to watch is going to be a nightmare!

Wikipedia to the rescue! It has a set of pages detailing all American films 
released in a particular year. For example:
    
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_films_of_1982
    
You can look at different pages by changing the year at the end of the URL
e.g. replacing 1982 with 1997

At the top of these pages is a table containing the top 10 highest-grossing films 
for that year. The structure of this page is pretty stable - every such page from
1970 onwards has this table.

YOUR TASK

In this exercise, you will create a python program that will scrape 
each such page from Wikipedia for the period 1970 to 2023. Using this 
information it will create a dataset of all the top-grossing movies, then open
the dataset and pick a movie at random.

MANDATORY

Do not use the wikipeia package or API

Ensure that you insert a pause of 3 seconds between requests for 
data to wikipedia. 

By "create a dataset", we mean you must save the data to a CSV file named
"movies.csv". Then, open the CSV file and pick a movie at random. Print 
the name of the chosen movie with the year in brackets e.g. John Wick (2004)

The CSV file must include the following columns: Year, Rank, Title, 
Distributor, Domestic gross

## Defining function to collect data from url 

def top_grossing_films(year):
    url = f"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_films_of_{year}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")
    ## before loading all tables we find that for the year 2021 the required table is table #2 instead of #1, so we fix this by:
    if year == 2021:
        table_no = 2
    else:
        table_no = 1
    ## extracting tables 
    table = soup.find_all("table")[table_no]
    
    rows = table.find_all("tr")
    extracted_table = [] 
    distributor_data = None
    for row in rows:
        cells = row.find_all(['td', 'th']) 
        row_headers = []
        for cell in cells:
            cell_data = cell.text.strip() 
            row_headers.append(cell_data)
            
            ## cleaning the content in cells due to merged cells and missing values 
            if len(cells) == 3:
                row_headers.extend([None] * (4 - len(row_headers)))    
                row_headers[3] = row_headers[2]
                row_headers[2] = distributor_data
            if row_headers:
                distributor_data = row_headers[2] if len(row_headers) >= 3 else None
            
        ## we find that there is a discrepency in the naming of the columns- in 1991 the column is
        ## named "Worldwide gross" and between 2014-16 its named "Domestic Gross" 
        if "Worldwide gross" in row_headers:
            row_headers[row_headers.index("Worldwide gross")] = "Domestic gross"
        if "Domestic Gross" in row_headers:
            row_headers[row_headers.index("Domestic Gross")] = "Domestic gross"
        
        extracted_table.append(row_headers)
        
        final_headers = extracted_table[0]
        final_data = extracted_table[1:]
    
    best_films = pd.DataFrame(final_data, columns= final_headers)
    best_films["Year"] = year 
    return best_films 


## Creating loop that collects data from each year 
final_films = pd.DataFrame()

for year in range(1970,2024):
    print(f"Scraped movies for {year}")
    best_films = top_grossing_films(year)
    final_films = pd.concat([final_films, best_films], ignore_index=True)
    time.sleep(3)
print(best_films.head())
    
## saving dataframe as csv 
os.chdir("C:/Users/Riya/Desktop/Harris Year 1/Spring Quarter/Data & Programming I Python")
best_films.to_csv('top grossing films.csv', index = False)


## opening the file & selecting a random film 
path = r"C:/Users/Riya/Desktop/Harris Year 1/Spring Quarter/Data & Programming I Python/top grossing films.csv"
movie_night_list = pd.read_csv(path)

selection = movie_night_list.sample()
print(f"Tonight you should watch: {selection['Title'].values[0]} ({selection['Year'].values[0]})")
